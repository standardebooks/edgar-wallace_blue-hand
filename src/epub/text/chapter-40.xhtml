<div><h1>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1></div>

<p>Whilst Jim had been making his search of the deserted
house, Eunice had strolled to the edge of the terrace,
and, leaning on the broken balustrade, was drinking in the
beauty of the scene. Thin wraiths of mist still lingered in the
purple shadows of the woods and lay like finest muslin in the
hollows. In the still air the blue-grey smoke of the cottagers’
fires showed above the tree-tops, and the sun had touched the
surface of a stream that wound through a distant valley, so
that it showed as a thread of bubbling gold amidst the verdant
green.</p>

<p>Somebody touched her gently on the shoulder. She thought
it was Jim.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovely, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Very lovely, but not half as lovely as you, my dear.”</p>

<p>She could have collapsed at the voice. Swinging round she
came face to face with Digby Groat, and uttered a little cry.</p>

<p>“If you want to save Steele’s life,” said Digby in a low
urgent tone, “you will not cry out, you understand?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He put his arm round her shoulder and she shivered, but
it was no caress he offered. He was guiding her swiftly into
the house. He swung open a door and, pushing her through,
followed.</p>

<p>There was a man in the room, a tall, dour man, who held a
rope in his hand.</p>

<p>“Wait, Masters,” whispered Digby. “We’ll get him as
he comes back.” He had heard the footsteps of Jim in the
hall and then suddenly there was a scuffle.</p>

<p>Eunice opened her lips to cry a warning, but Digby’s hand
covered her mouth and his face was against her ear.</p>

<p>“Remember what I told you,” he whispered.</p>

<p>There was a shout outside, it was from Xavier, and Masters
dashed out ahead of his employer. Jim’s back was turned
to the open door, and Digby signalled. Immediately the rope
slipped round Jim’s neck and he was pulled breathlessly to the
ground; his face grew purple and his hands were tearing at
the cruel noose. They might have choked him then and there,
but that Eunice, who had stood for a moment paralysed, flew
out of the room and, thrusting Masters aside, knelt down and
with her own trembling hands released the noose about her
lover’s neck.</p>

<p>“You beasts, you beasts!” she cried, her eyes flashing her
hate.</p>

<p>In an instant Digby was on her and had lifted her clear.</p>

<p>“Rope him,” he said laconically, and gave his attention
to the struggling girl. For now Eunice was no longer quiescent.
She fought with all her might, striking at his face with her
hands, striving madly to free herself of his grip.</p>

<p>“You little devil!” he cried breathlessly, when he had
secured her wrists and had thrust her against the wall. There
was an ugly red mark where her nails had caught his face, but
in his eyes there was nothing but admiration.</p>

<p>“That is how I like you best,” he breathed. “My dear,
I have never regretted my choice of you! I regret it least
at this moment!”</p>

<p>“Release my hands!” she stormed. She was panting
painfully, and, judging that she was incapable of further
mischief, he obeyed.</p>

<p>“Where have you taken Jim? What have you done with
him?” she asked, her wide eyes fixed on his. There was no
fear in them now. He had told her that he had seen the devil
in her. Now it was fully aroused.</p>

<p>“We have taken your young friend to a place of safety,”
said Digby. “What happened this morning, Eunice?”</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>“Where is Villa?”</p>

<p>Still she did not answer.</p>

<p>“Very good,” he said. “If you won’t speak I’ll find a
way of making your young man very valuable.”</p>

<p>“You’d make him speak!” she said scornfully. “You
don’t know the man you’re dealing with. I don’t think
you’ve ever met that type in the drawing-rooms you visited
during the war. The real men were away in France, Digby
Groat. They were running the risks you shirked, facing the
dangers you feared. If you think you can make Jim Steele
talk, go along and try!”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re saying,” he said, white to
the lips, for her calculated insult had touched him on the
raw. “I can make him scream for mercy.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“You judge all men by yourself,” she said, “and all women
by the poor little shop-girls you have broken for your amusement.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what you’re saying?” he said, quivering
with rage. “You seem to forget that I am——”</p>

<p>“I forget what you are!” she scoffed. The colour had come
back to her face and her eyes were bright with anger. “You’re
a half-breed, a man of no country and no class, and you have
all the attributes of a half-breed. Digby Groat, a threatener
of women and an assassin of men, a thief who employs other
thieves to take the risks whilst he takes the lion’s share of
the loot. A quack experimenter, who knows enough of
medicines to drug women and enough of surgery to torture
animals—I have no doubt about <span class='it'>you</span>!”</p>

<p>For a long time he could not speak. She had insulted him
beyond forgiveness, and with an uncanny instinct had discovered
just the things to say that would hurt him most.</p>

<p>“Put out your hands,” he almost yelled, and she obeyed,
watching him contemptuously as he bound them together
with the cravat which he had torn from his neck.</p>

<p>He took her by the shoulders and, pushing her feet from her
ungently, sat her in a corner.</p>

<p>“I’ll come back and deal with you, my lady,” he growled.</p>

<p>Outside in the hall Masters was waiting for him, and the
big, uncouth man was evidently troubled.</p>

<p>“Where have you put him?”</p>

<p>“In the east wing, in the old butler’s rooms,” he said,
ill at ease. “Mr. Groat, isn’t this a bad business?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, bad business?” snarled Digby.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been mixed up in this kind of thing before,”
said Masters. “Isn’t there a chance that they will have the
law on us?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, you’ll be well paid,” snapped his employer,
and was going away when the man detained him.</p>

<p>“Being well paid won’t keep me out of prison, if this is a
prison job,” he said. “I come of respectable people, and
I’ve never been in trouble all my life. I’m well-known in the
country, and although I’m not very popular in the village,
yet nobody can point to me and say that I’ve done a prison
job.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool,” said Digby, glad to have some one to vent
his rage upon. “Haven’t I told you that this man has been
trying to run off with my wife?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t say anything about her being your wife,”
said Masters, shaking his head and looking suspiciously at
the other, “and, besides, she’s got no wedding-ring. That’s
the first thing I noticed. And that foreign man hadn’t any
right to strike with his cane—it might have killed him.”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Masters,” said Digby, controlling himself,
for it was necessary that the man should be humoured, “don’t
trouble your head about affairs that you can’t understand.
I tell you this man Steele is a scoundrel who has run away
with my wife and has stolen a lot of money. My wife is not
quite normal, and I am taking her away for a voyage .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
He checked himself. “Anyway, Steele is a scoundrel,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Then why not hand him over to the police,” said the
uneasy Masters, “and bring him before the justices? That
seems to me the best thing to do, Mr. Groat. You’re going
to get a bad name if it comes out that you treated this gentleman
as roughly as you did.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t treat him roughly,” said Digby coolly, “and it
was you who slipped the rope round his neck.”</p>

<p>“I tried to get it over his shoulders,” explained Masters
hastily; “besides, you told me to do it.”</p>

<p>“You’d have to prove that,” said Digby, knowing that he
was on the right track. “Now listen to me, Masters. The
only person who has committed any crime so far has been
you!”</p>

<p>“Me?” gasped the man. “I only carried out your orders.”</p>

<p>“You’d have to prove that before your precious justices,”
said Digby, with a laugh, and dropped his hand on the man’s
shoulder, a piece of familiarity which came strangely to
Masters, who had never known his employer in such an
amiable mood. “Go along and get some food ready for the
young lady,” he said, “and if there is any trouble, I’ll see
that you get clear of it. And here.” He put his hand in his
pocket and took out a wad of notes, picked two of them out
and pressed them into the man’s hand. “They are twenty-pound
banknotes, my boy, and don’t forget it and try to
change them as fivers. Now hurry along and get your wife
to find some refreshment for the young lady.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what my wife’s going to say about it,”
grumbled the man, “when I tell her——”</p>

<p>“Tell her nothing,” said Digby sharply. “Damn you,
don’t you understand plain English?”</p>

<p>At three o’clock that afternoon a hired car brought two
passengers before the ornamental gate of Kennett Hall, and
the occupants, failing to secure admission, climbed the high
wall and came trudging up towards the house.</p>

<p>Digby saw them from a distance and went down to meet
the bedraggled Bronson and the dark-skinned Spaniard who
was his companion. They met at the end of the drive, and
Bronson and his master, speaking together, made the same
inquiry in identical terms:</p>

<p>“Where is Villa?”</p>
