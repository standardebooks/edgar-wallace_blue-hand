<div><h1>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1></div>

<p>The lawyer explained his presence without preliminary,
and Jim listened moodily.</p>

<p>“I came with them myself because I know the place,”
said Mr. Salter, looking at Jim anxiously. “You look
ghastly, Steele. Can’t you lie down and get some sleep?”</p>

<p>“I feel that I shall never sleep until I have got my hand
on Digby Groat. What was it you saw in the paper? Tell
me again. How did they know it was Villa?”</p>

<p>“By a receipt in his pocket,” replied Salter. “It appears
that Villa, probably acting on behalf of Digby Groat, had
purchased from Maxilla, the Brazilian gambler, his yacht,
the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Pealigo</i>——”</p>

<p>Jim uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“That is where he has gone,” he said. “Where is the
<i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Pealigo</i>?”</p>

<p>“That I have been trying to find out,” replied the lawyer,
shaking his head, “but nobody seems to know. She left
Havre a few days ago, but what her destination was, nobody
knows. She has certainly not put in to any British port
so far as we can ascertain. Lloyd’s were certain of this,
and every ship, whether it is a yacht, a liner, or a cargo
tramp, is reported to Lloyd’s.”</p>

<p>“That is where he has gone,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Then she must be in port,” said old Salter eagerly. “We
can telegraph to every likely place——”</p>

<p>Jim interrupted him with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Bronson would land on the water and sink the machine.
It is a very simple matter,” he said. “I have been in the
sea many times and there is really no danger, if you are provided
with life-belts, and are not strapped to the seat. It is
foul luck your not coming before.”</p>

<p>He walked wearily from the comfortable parlour of the inn
where the conversation had taken place.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I am alone for a little while? I want to
think,” he said.</p>

<p>He turned as he was leaving the room.</p>

<p>“In order not to waste time, Mr. Salter,” he said quietly,
“have you any influence with the Admiralty? I want the
loan of a seaplane.”</p>

<p>Mr. Salter looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“That can be fixed,” he said. “I will get on to the ’phone
straight away to the Admiralty and try to get the First Sea
Lord. He will do all that he can to help us.”</p>

<p>Whilst the lawyer telephoned, Jim made a hasty meal.
The pace had told on him and despair was in his heart.</p>

<p>The knowledge that Digby Groat would eventually be
brought to justice did not comfort him. If Eunice had only
been spared he would have been content to see Digby make
his escape, and would not have raised his hand to stop him
going. He would have been happy even if, in getting away,
the man had been successful in carrying off the girl’s fortune.
But Eunice was in his wicked hands and the thought of it
was unendurable.</p>

<p>He was invited by the local police-sergeant to step across
to the little lock-up to interview the man Masters, who was
under arrest, and as Mr. Salter had not finished telephoning,
he crossed the village street and found the dour man in a
condition of abject misery.</p>

<p>“I knew he’d bring me into this,” he wailed, “and me with
a wife and three children and not so much as a poaching case
against me! Can’t you speak a word for me, sir?”</p>

<p>Jim’s sense of humour was never wholly smothered and
the cool request amused him.</p>

<p>“I can only say that you tried to strangle me,” he said.
“I doubt whether that good word will be of much service
to you.”</p>

<p>“I swear I didn’t mean to,” pleaded the man. “He told
me to put the rope round your shoulders and it slipped. How
was I to know that the lady wasn’t his wife who’d run away
with you?”</p>

<p>“So that is the story he told you?” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the man said eagerly. “I pointed out to Mr.
Groat that the lady hadn’t a wedding-ring, but he said that
he was married all right and he was taking her to sea——”</p>

<p>“To sea?”</p>

<p>Masters nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s what he said, sir—he said she wasn’t right in her
head and the sea voyage would do her a lot of good.”</p>

<p>Jim questioned him closely without getting any further
information. Masters knew nothing of the steamer on which
Digby and his “wife” were to sail, or the port at which he
would embark.</p>

<p>Outside the police station Jim interviewed the sergeant.</p>

<p>“I don’t think this man was any more than a dupe of
Groat’s,” he said, “and I certainly have no charge to make
against him.”</p>

<p>The sergeant shook his head.</p>

<p>“We must hold him until we have had the inquest on the
Spaniard,” he said, and then, gloomily, “To think that I
had a big case like this right under my nose and hadn’t the
sense to see it!”</p>

<p>Jim smiled a little sadly.</p>

<p>“We have all had the case under our noses, sergeant, and
we have been blinder than you!”</p>

<hr/>

<p>The threat of a renewed dose of the drug had been sufficient
to make Eunice acquiescent. Resistance, she knew, was
useless. Digby could easily overpower her for long enough
to jab his devilish needle into her arm.</p>

<p>She had struggled at first and had screamed at the first
prick from the needle-point. It was that scream Jim had
heard.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you; I promise you I will not give you any
trouble,” she said. “Please don’t use that dreadful thing
again.”</p>

<p>Time was pressing and it would be easier to make his escape
if the girl did not resist than if she gave him trouble.</p>

<p>The propeller was ticking slowly round when they climbed
into the fuselage.</p>

<p>“There is room for me, señor. There must be room for
me!”</p>

<p>Digby looked down into the distorted face of the Spaniard
who had come running after him.</p>

<p>“There is no room for you, Fuentes,” he said. “I have
told you before. You must get away as well as you can.”</p>

<p>“I am going with you!”</p>

<p>To Digby’s horror, the man clung desperately to the side
of the fuselage. Every moment was increasing their peril,
and in a frenzy he whipped out his pistol.</p>

<p>“Let go,” he hissed, “or I’ll kill you,” but still the man
held on.</p>

<p>There were voices coming from the lower path, and, in his
panic, Digby fired. He saw the man crumple and fall and
yelled to Bronson:</p>

<p>“Go, go!”</p>

<p>Eunice, a horrified spectator, could only stare at the thing
which had been Digby Groat, for the change which had come
over him was extraordinary. He seemed to have shrunk in
stature. His face was twisted, like a man who had had a
stroke of paralysis.</p>

<p>She thought this was the case, but slowly he began to
recover.</p>

<p>He had killed a man! The horror of this act was upon
him, the fear of the consequence which would follow overwhelmed
him and drove him into a momentary frenzy. He
had killed a man! He could have shrieked at the thought.
He, who had so carefully guarded himself against punishment,
who had manœuvred his associates into danger, whilst he
himself stood in a safe place, was now a fugitive from a justice
which would not rest until it had lain him by the heel.</p>

<p>And she had seen him, she, the woman at his side, and
would go into the box and testify against him! And they
would hang him! In that brick-lined pit of which Jim Steele
had spoken. All these thoughts flashed through his mind
in a second, even before the machine left the ground, but
with the rush of cold air and the inevitable exhilaration of
flight, he began to think calmly again.</p>
